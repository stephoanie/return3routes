<h2> About me </h2>

<h4> Hi my name is Stephanie Caamano. I am 20 years old, soon 21 in November. I go to Lehman College and work at the Bronx Zoo. 
    When I am not working or at school I like to watch shows especially with my sisters. My favorite shows at the moment is Stranger Things 
    and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. When time allows it, I also like to travel. My most recent trip was in August to Cancun. I enjoyed
    it very much and it was a nice reminder to stay in school to get my money up so I can travel more. I also really like cars although
    I am currently carless :(
